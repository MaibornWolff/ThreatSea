## Releases

ThreatSea uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automated versioning and releases. Releases are automatically created when changes are pushed to the `main` or `next` branch, following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Release Process

1. **Automatic Releases**: When code is pushed to `main` or `next` branch, the CI pipeline will:
   - Run all tests and quality checks
   - Analyze commit messages to determine the next version number
   - Create a GitHub release with release notes
   - Build and publish Docker container images to GitHub Container Registry

2. **Container Images**: The following Docker images are published:
   - `maibornwolff/threatsea:{ latest | release version }` - published on Docker Hub
   - `ghcr.io/maibornwolff/threatsea:{ latest | next | (pre-)release version }` - published on GitHub Container Registry (includes prerelease versions)

3. **Versioning**: Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
   - `feat:` commits trigger a **minor** version bump
   - `fix:`, `perf:`, `revert:` commits trigger a **patch** version bump
   - Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in the footer trigger a **major** version bump

### Commit Message Format

Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for your commit messages:

```txt
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

- `feat: add new threat analysis feature`
- `fix: resolve authentication issue`
- `docs: update installation guide`
